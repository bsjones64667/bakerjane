    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>


      Hello! My name is Jane and I am the founder of Baker Jane. I am a home baker that is located on the west side of
      Cincinnati, West Side's the Best Side! Back in 2020, making cookies started out as a hobby to pass the time away
      from the craziness of covid, but this pastime quickly turned into a passion. I specialize in sugar cookies,
      cakes, cupcakes and more.<br><br>I am married to my husband Dominic and we have a wild child named
      Lorenzo. We have two pets, a bunny named Apollo and a Cat named Festus. I have a full time job in the healthcare
      field but love baking more than anything. I'm so excited to see where this takes me, and am looking forward to all
      of your future orders.
